# chainlist

Run the following command to run the program:

`node process.js`

There are 1213 chainIds.

From those, there are 55 chainIds that don't have RPCs. To search for the chainIds without rpcs, search "rpc": [] in the original_rpcs.json file.

Approximately there are 391 chainIds which RPCs are not working. To check for that search for the arrays that contain [x, x, null] in the rpc_test.json file.
